**Before submitting a pull request,** please make sure the following is done:

1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/rubenbase/rufrontgen) and create your branch from `master`.
2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.
3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.
5. Run `yarn test-prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.
6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press "Inspect".
7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).
